blameP4
=======

Perforce is old and crufty, and I blame it for slowing me down when trying to
get my work done. Oh wait, that's not the point of this...

The main frontend for Perforce, P4V, doesn't have an interface for annotating
code, a.k.a. "blaming" others (or your past self). `blameP4` is a simple
frontend for viewing annotated code and the associated commit message.

This is mainly a pet project for scratching an itch and learning a bit more
about [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
and [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).
Don't expect stability or maintenance.


Using blameP4
-------------

To install, just navigate to the directory containing this file and install:

    cd path/to/this/directory
    npm install

Then start the frontend by running:

    npm start


Why Perforce?
-------------

I have to use it for my day job.
